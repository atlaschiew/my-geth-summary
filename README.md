# my-geth-summary
I was PHP developer with experience for more than 10 years. I found myself weak in things such as data structure, because most of time data structure stuff is handled by MYSQL and PHP array internally. Until i deal with GETH in all these days, i have to catch up all these knowledge points in order to understand better to codes of GETH! 

Notes under this repo just mainly to serve myself only :) i may or may not write in details, it depends on my busyness.
